C# (.NET) â€“ Core programming language
OOP Concepts â€“ Classes, interfaces, and inheritance for structured code
Visual Studio 2022 â€“ IDE for development


ðŸ”¹ SOLID Principles Applied
âœ” S â€“ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class handles only one responsibility.
âœ” O â€“ Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The system is designed to be extendable without modifying existing code.
âœ” L â€“ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):Child classes can replace parent classes without breaking functionality.
âœ” I â€“ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Interfaces are broken down to ensure clients donâ€™t depend on unnecessary methods.
âœ” D â€“ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.

ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements
 Database Integration â€“ Implement persistent storage using MySQL or MongoDB.
 Admin Dashboard â€“ Add an admin panel for better system management.
